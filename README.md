# ExData_Plotting2

This repository holds the various plots and corresponding R code for the Exploratory Data Course, Course Project 2, including:

**Plot 1**. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? This plot shows the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

**Plot 2**. This plot explores the trend in total emissions from PM2.5 in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008?

**Plot 3**. This plot determines which of the four types of sources, indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City and which have seen increases for the same time frame.

**Plot 4**. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008? This plot looks at the change in emissions by source by year.

**Plot 5**. This plot explores how the emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City.

**Plot 6**. Finally, this plot compares emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). In it, we answer the question, "Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?"
